# Emote Marketing Tool

This tool is made for my girlfriend to make her life a little easier when creating promotianal images for her Ko-fi shop. Since I can imagine it's useful for many people, I figured to make it public for everyone.

## What does the tool do?

The tool allows you to upload an emote of any size and resize it to desired sizes, download them and also showcase these emotes on various backgrounds.

- Upload any emote (works best with square sizes)
- Add any size you want your icon resizes to
- Download the resized emotes in jpg, png or webp in a single zip.
- Showcase your emotes on various backgounds
- Configure colors, paddings, labels, font, alignment
- Choose from presets for Twitch, Discord and YouTube
- Download the previews separately or combined

## How to use

1. Go to [The Emote Marketing tool](https://oceanscurse.github.io/EmoteMarketingTool/)
2. Upload your emote
3. Configure as needed
4. Download your resized emotes and promotional material

### Future potential updates

If the tool gets enough traction or if the features become needed I might still add some more features.

- Saving your custom preset
- More Google fonts (it's easily added if you would want a font on request,just add a ticket in the issues tab)
